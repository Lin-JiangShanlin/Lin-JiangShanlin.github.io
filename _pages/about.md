<!-- ## A short introduction -->
<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
I am currently doing my master's program at College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://kaminzzz.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhenan He</a>. My main research area during the master study including multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty and evolutionary computation, in which I have published one paper in the leading journals <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4235" target="_blank">IEEE TEVC</a>.
</p>

**Research Interests**
* Modeling method for translating real-world problem into subtle problem structure, i.e., mixed integer programming.
* Exact methods, Metaheuristics, and Hybrid Algorithm.
* Applications in Industrial Intelligence, Transportation, and New Energy Problem.

**Journal Publications**
S. Jiang, G. G. Yen, and Z. He, “A Multi-Scenario Optimization Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Transfer Framework,” in IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, early access, 2022, doi: 10.1109/TEVC.2022.3211643.
