## A short introduction
I am currently doing my master's program at College of Computer Science, Sichuan University. My research interests including three parts, 1) the modeling method for translating real-world problem into subtle problem structure, i.e., mixed integer programming. 2) the algorithms designed for effectively solving the constructed problem with hybrid algorithms, which combine exact methods and metaheuristics. 3) the applications in transportation systems and new energy problem.

PROFILE:
* Highly self-motivated researcher with demonstrated research expertise modeling hydro-climatology processes. 
* Strong adaptability and learning ability. Good communication and coordination skills.
* Optimistic and positive, a team player, able to work under pressure
* Programming Skills: Python, C++.
